This GitHub is my data science and engineering playground. Think of it as a workbench filled with experiments I built while learning and expanding my workflow.

Each project follows a clear path: wrangling data, cleaning it up, analyzing extensively to understand the problem, and building production-ready models â€“ both classification and regression. Some projects prioritize education, skipping steps to highlight core concepts.

It's a win-win: solidifies my knowledge and lets others learn from my work.

Feel free to reach out on LinkedIn to share feedback, knowledge, and thoughts â€“ always eager to learn from others!
