This GitHub is my data science playground. Think of it as a messy workbench overflowing with cool experiments (mostly Jupyter notebooks) I built while learning and expanding my workflow.

Each project follows a clear path: wrangling data, cleaning it up, analyzing extensively to understand the problem (think model prep!), and building production-ready machine learning models â€“ both classification and regression. 

Some projects prioritize education, skipping steps to highlight the core concepts. It's a win-win â€“ solidifies my knowledge and lets others learn from my tinkering.

Feel free to hit me up on LinkedIn to share feedback, knowledge, and thoughts â€“ eager to learn from others!
